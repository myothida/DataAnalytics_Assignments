# Data Analytics Project: Exploring Factors for Successful Completion of Training Workshop Series

## Overview
Despite a significant number of applicants, there is a notable decline in attendance at the entrance exams, with only half of the applicants participating. By analyzing factors contributing to this dropout, we aim to uncover insights that can inform strategies to improve the overall commitment to the application process.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to investigate the dropout phenomenon occurring between the application and entrance examination stages for online courses.

## Scope
- Analyze participant demographics and characteristics to understand if there are any correlations with commitment levels.
- Investigate reasons why applicants do not proceed to the entrance examination stage, such as scheduling conflicts, lack of interest, or technical issues.
- Analyze how communication channels are utilized to inform applicants about the entrance examination and whether there are opportunities for improvement.
- Identify any barriers or challenges applicants may face during the transition from application to entrance examination

## Deliverables
- Insights and recommendations to reduce the dropout rates between the application and entrance examination stages for online courses.

## Exercise 01: Demo-graphic Analysis 

### Input Dataset
Input datasets: demo_data.csv

### Objective
Explore participant demographics and characteristics.

## Exercise 02: Reasons for Non-Proceeding to Entrance Examination

### Survey Design:
Design a survey questionnaire to gather information from applicants who did not proceed to the entrance examination stage.
Include questions about reasons for non-proceeding, such as scheduling conflicts, lack of interest, or technical issues.
### Data Collection:
Distribute the survey to the targeted group of non-proceeding applicants through email or online platforms.
Collect responses from the survey participants.
### Data Analysis:
Compile and organize the survey responses into a structured dataset.
Analyze the survey data to identify the most common reasons cited by applicants for not proceeding to the entrance examination stage.

## Exercise 03: Communication Channel Analysis

### Data Collection:
Gather data on the communication channels utilized to inform applicants about the entrance examination.
Include information on email notifications, website announcements, social media posts, etc.
### Communication Channel Assessment:
Analyze the effectiveness of each communication channel in reaching and engaging applicants.
Evaluate metrics such as open rates, click-through rates, and response rates for email notifications and other channels.
### Feedback Collection:
Collect feedback from applicants regarding their preferred communication channels and any suggestions for improvement.

## Exercise 04: Identifying Barriers and Challenges

### Stakeholder Interviews:
Conduct interviews with applicants who did not proceed to the entrance examination stage to gather qualitative insights.
Explore any barriers or challenges they encountered during the transition from application to entrance examination.
### Data Analysis:
Analyze interview transcripts or qualitative data to identify common themes and patterns related to barriers and challenges.
Categorize the identified barriers into distinct groups (e.g., logistical barriers, motivational barriers, technical barriers).
### Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, propose recommendations for addressing the identified barriers and challenges to improve the application process and increase participation rates.
